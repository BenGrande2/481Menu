# 481-Menu

Horizontal prototype for CPSC481

How to contribute:

We'll use forks of this repository for development. Any changes will need a pull request to be merged back.

    (Everyone except Ben do 1-3 the first time:)
	
	1. Fork the repository (if it i
	2. Clone the repo from your account
	3. Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/BenGrande2/481Menu.git`
	
	
	4. When you want to work on something, create a separate branch for it
	    * `git checkout -b branch-name`
	5. When you're done developing, commit and push the branch to your repository
	    * `git add -A`
		* `git commit -m "<message here>"`
		* `git push origin branch-name
	
	(Ben, you can should be able to just create a pull request to merge your branch directly with master from here)
	
	6. Create a pull request by going to your github repo, and hitting the 'Create Pull Request' button that appears. You can also do this from Ben's repository
	7. Someone will approve or reject the merge`
	8. Make sure you keep your local repo up to date with the remote one.
	    * `git fetch upstream`
		* `git merge upstream/master`
		* `git push origin master`
		
		
		
	   Your local repo is now updated with the remote one.

	  (Ben doesn't need to do 8 as he is always working from the most up to date repo)
